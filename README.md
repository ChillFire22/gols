# gols
A simple go library providing index-based interfacing to paths of files within a given directory. Leveraged by (CLI) tools to replace path-as-input with much easier and less error-prone index-as-input.

# Functionality
Collects the paths of files within a given directory and casts them into an indexed internal structure. Providing an index returns the corresponding path.
Appropriate functions include returning the internal structure as raw text, CSV, or JSON.
The first version is V-0.0.1 and is called the first prototype version, ensuring minimal but working functionality

# Extra
Any extra functionality is open for discussion and future implementation

# Warning
This library is provided as-is with no guarantees.
